### Postharvest Losses from Temperature During Transit: Evidence from a Million Truckloads (With Tim Beatty)
![](../assets/cubic_lu_percent_3d_pval.png){: width="500" }{: .align-left}  
We estimate the effect of weather and climate change on postharvest losses from data on 1.4 million truckloads of processing tomatoes in California. Our reduced-form estimation strategy compares processing tomatoes grown in the same field in the same season but experience different weather and traffic conditions during transit. Hot temperatures during transportation damage product quality, particularly when hot temperatures coincide with heavy traffic. When we compare best- and worst-case temperature and traffic conditions, the average rate of damage doubles and truckload profits decline by 1.3%. We predict climate change will increase postharvest losses by century's end absent additional adaptation.

### Margins of Response to Water Scarcity in Irrigated Agriculture
![](../assets/water_districts.png){: width="500" }{: .align-left}  
Adapting to less water is critical to a food-secure future in light of an increasingly variable and scarce water supply. Farmers respond to water scarcity by changing if they plant and what they plant, but there is inconclusive evidence on whether farmers change *how* they produce. I analyze farmers' decisions using a panel of 3,300 irrigated fields in California from 2011--2021. I use novel proprietary data on growing practices collected by a large tomato processor. It provides evidence of the mechanisms by which growers use water more efficiently -- insights unattainable in publicly available or survey data. I find that during a water scarce year, tomato growers are more likely to plant earlier, plant fast maturing varieties, and preferentially plant fields equipped with drip irrigation rather than less water efficient technologies. Water access priority drives how growers conserve water: growers with low-priority access rely on more costly margins, such as fallowing or changing growing practices in ways that reduce revenue. This demonstrates that agricultural producers engage in water-saving practices more than is typically assumed and that these practices help growers avoid fallowing, a much more costly response.
