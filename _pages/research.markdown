### Climate Change and Labour Market Strain: Heat Stress Impacts on Farmworker Productivity and Farm Viability (With Katie Ricketts)

In high-income countries, labour expenses represent a significant share of the overall costs of producing food. Farmwork is often physically demanding and outdoors, making agricultural workers among the most vulnerable populations to heat stress. In the context of Australia’s $18 billion fruits, vegetables, and horticultural (FVH) industries, we quantify the effect of increasing temperatures on labour productivity using climate projection models together with government datasets. We find that FVH workers will be significantly less productive by mid-century due to the psychological and physiological burden of hotter temperatures. We project higher operating costs for FVH farms that will need to pay for more working hours to achieve the same amount of work as the baseline period. The costs of reduced labour productivity double under an assumption of labour supply shortages like those experienced in other high-income agricultural industries. This is one of many mechanisms---alongside yield, quality, pest and disease pressure, and water availability---through which climate change threatens farm profitability and food system resilience.

### Margins of Response to Water Scarcity in Irrigated Agriculture
![](../assets/water_districts.png){: width="500" }{: .align-left}  
Irrigated agriculture is vital for food security, but it relies on an increasingly variable and scarce water supply. I study the effect of water scarcity on farmers' extensive and intensive margins on over 100,000 fields in California between 2010 and 2021. I find that during a water scarce year, growers engage in both intensive and extensive margin adjustments by roughly equal amounts. This work demonstrates agricultural producers engage in water-saving practices more than what has been previously found and that these practices help growers avoid fallowing, a more costly response.
